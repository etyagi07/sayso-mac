"""Turn a transcript into a structured intent.

Rule-based and offline. The rule for anything that would trade: every word
must have a known job - an action, an index, call or put, a company, a
number in a clear role, intraday or delivery, or harmless filler. A word
with no job means the sentence is asked about, not guessed at. Ignoring
unknown words is what turned "buy nifty call stop loss 5" into 5 lots and
"is my nifty call closed?" into an exit.
