"""Measure this microphone, in this room, and set the speech threshold.

Run: python -m voice.calibrate

The threshold that decides "you stopped talking" depends entirely on the
hardware and the room. Set it too low and the fan keeps the recording
open forever; too high and it cuts you off mid-sentence. Measuring both
the silence floor and actual speech, then placing the threshold between
them, is the only reliable way to get it right on an unknown machine.
