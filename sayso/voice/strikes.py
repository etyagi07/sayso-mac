"""Read spoken strike prices.

Traders' shorthand does not follow number grammar: "twenty three fifty"
means 23,050, not 2,350, and "twenty three one hundred" means 23,100, not
2,400. Rather than guess which convention was used, generate every
plausible reading and let the live strike ladder decide - near spot,
strikes are sparse (multiples of 50 within a few hundred points), so
wrong readings simply do not exist as instruments.

This module is pure: it proposes candidates. Resolution against the real
ladder happens where market data is available.
