"""Spoken readback and outcome sounds, so eyes can stay on the chart.

Two guarantees shape this module:

- It never talks over the microphone. Pressing to talk stops any speech or
  sound first - push-to-talk, the way a radio works - and anything
  announced while recording waits until it stops. Otherwise the app's own
  readback - "buy one lot of the Nifty call" - could be heard as a command.
- It never blocks the confirmation screen. Speech runs on its own thread;
  the box appears at once and the voice reads it out alongside.

Uses what the operating system already has: `say` and system sounds on
macOS, SAPI through PowerShell on Windows, espeak on Linux. No extra
dependencies, and if none is available it stays silent rather than failing.
