"""Repair a transcript against the vocabulary we actually trade in.

Speech recognition produces near-misses that are obvious to a human and
invisible to a regex: "put" comes back as "button", YESBANK as "years
bank". Rather than widening every pattern, normalise the words first, so
the parser only ever sees canonical vocabulary.

Only known mishearings are rewritten - the lists below. There is no
"close enough" guessing: it once turned "all" into "call", so "exit all yes
bank" closed a Nifty option. A word that isn't on a list is left alone, and
the parser asks about it.
