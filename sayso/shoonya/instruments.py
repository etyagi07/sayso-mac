"""Derivative contract lookup, from Shoonya's public symbol master.

The master file needs no authentication, so contracts can be resolved even
when the F&O segment is not enabled on the account - only quoting and
trading them requires that.

Format note: the official docs give option symbols as NIFTY24DEC24000CE.
That form does not exist. Real contracts look like NIFTY29SEP26C23450 -
underlying, then DDMMMYY of expiry, then C or P, then the strike. Symbols
here are always read from the master, never constructed by hand.
