"""Intent-level operations, shaped for a voice agent to call as tools.

Each function takes plain arguments a speech-to-intent layer can produce and
returns a dict that is easy to read back out loud.

Two rules run through this module:

- An error is never allowed to look like an empty result. The broker answers
  "no positions" and "session expired" with the same status; the SDK turns
  both into None, and "you have no positions" is then a lie. BrokerError
  exists so that cannot happen.
- An order's outcome is never guessed. A dropped connection after sending
  does not mean the order was rejected - it may be live. When the outcome is
  unknown, it is reconciled against the order book or reported as unknown.
