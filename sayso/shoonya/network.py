"""Is this computer on an internet address the API key accepts?

Every API call - login, reads, orders - is checked against the addresses
registered on the broker's Api Key Generation page (SEBI requires it for
API trading). Home broadband and phone hotspots change address without
warning, and the broker's refusal is unhelpful, so this checks up front
and says plainly what is wrong.

The registered addresses are asked for once per account and kept in the
account file - they are not credentials. The current address comes from a
public lookup service: one small request that tells that service your
address and nothing else. It is never on the order path.
