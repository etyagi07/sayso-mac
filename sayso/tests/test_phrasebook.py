"""The phrasebook: what Sayso does with each thing you might say.

Read this file to know how it behaves. Each line is a sentence and what
must happen. The rule behind it: every word in an order has a known job -
action, index, call or put, a company, a number in a clear role, intraday
or delivery, or harmless filler. A sentence with a word that has no job is
asked about, never guessed at, because a guess here is a real trade.

Runs offline.
