"""The agent layer, against a fake broker.

This is where the bugs that matter live: being told an order is pending when
none was sent, a confirmed symbol being swapped for another, an edited price
being ignored, an expired session reading as an empty account. Each test
below is one of those, found in review and kept here so it cannot return.

Runs offline - nothing here touches the network or the real daily counters.
